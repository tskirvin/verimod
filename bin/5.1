>> What's wrong with hedonism?
>Not hygienic?

--[quote from Shelton]--
   The man who "lives to eat" has been roundly condemned so much and s=
o
often that he needs no added censure from my pen. I believe that we
should enjoy our food. Indeed, I believe that he who derives the
greatest possible pleasure and enjoyment from his food, will have
better health than the man who does not enjoy his meals. I have no
patience with the doctrine of anti-naturalism that prevailed during th=
e
Middle Ages, and remnants of which still prevail--that all pleasures
are evil. I do not regard a state of chronic misery as man's natural
state nor loud groans as evidence of piety.
--[end quote]--

But this is not quite the same as advocating hedonism, as I understand
that word.  The same author in another book makes a distinction betwee=
n
eating for pleasure and taking pleasure in eating. I'm not able to fin=
d
that passage at the moment. I think it's in one of Shelton's books tha=
t
didn't yet make it to electronic form.

Also there is the subject of anopsology and the distinction between
"original" food and food changed by "culinary artifice". The
anopsologists have the theory that the sense of taste works more
reliably on the former than on the latter.  The very -purpose- of
"culinary artifice" is usually to make food taste better than its
nutritional merits. Also some raw-fooders will tell you that to them
(with their improved sense of taste) the best raw food tastes better
than any food that is "improved" by "culinary artifice".
